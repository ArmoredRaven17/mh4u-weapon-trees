# Notices and Attributions

The original source code of this project is MIT-licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The materials
below are not covered by that licence.

## Game IP

**Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate** and all related names, equipment, monsters, icons and data are
trademarks and © Capcom Co., Ltd. This project is an **unofficial fan-made weapon-tree viewer**. It is
not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Capcom.

## Game data and icons

All weapon stats, names, recipes and upgrade links in `docs/index.html` are embedded at build time
by [scripts/build.py](scripts/build.py) from the
[MH4U Collection Tracker](https://github.com/ArmoredRaven17/mh4u-collection-tracker)'s generated
`docs/data/`. That project reads them from a personally owned copy of the game, and its NOTICE
covers how. The weapon icons (the equipment box icons, in the game's Rare 1-10 colours), the Hunting
Horn note glyphs in the colours the game's HUD tints them, and the theme monster icons come from the
same project and are all the game's own. The coating bottles are MHGU's, taken from the
[MHGU Weapon Trees](https://github.com/ArmoredRaven17/mhgu-weapon-trees) page and matched to 4U's
coatings by colour. **No game files are redistributed.**

How weapons are grouped into lanes is this project's own layout choice and has no effect in the
game. See `scripts/build.py`.

## Icons from other projects

- **The camera-toggle book icons** come from mhgu-editor, as in the MHGU Weapon Trees page.

## UI assets

The titlebar, theme picker, textures and the MHFU font are shared with the same author's MHGU fan
apps. The MHGU Weapon Trees NOTICE gives their sources.

## Development: AI assistance

A large share of this project's code was written with **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**
(Anthropic), directed and reviewed by the author.
